export const arvexDesc = `Team-developed university project; also my very first experience with web development!

ArveX was a web-app designed to make creating invoices as simple as possible. Users could create their company's profile, add products or services they offer along with prices. \
When creating an invoice, users could simply select from their list of products/services, and the app would automatically calculate totals, taxes, and generate a PDF invoice. \
Estonian business registy API was used to auto-fill most of the client information when creating an invoice for a company. \
The app featured automated testing and production deployment to AWS via GitLab CI/CD pipelines.`

export const rpTimetableDesc = `My first bigger solo project - an ambitious, but sadly unfinished web app to streamline the creation and management of timetables for racing events.

During my work as a timekeeper and assisting with organizing at various motorsport events, I noticed the need for a better tool to handle the creation and \
updating of event timetables. This was usually done in Excel, which required a lot of manual work and was prone to mistakes. The most challenging part was updating the timetable to consistently match \
an event's ever-changing timeframe. 

This app allowed users to create new events, define competing classes and their respective sessions, along with the lengths and breaks. \
The app would then automatically generate a timetable that could be easily adjusted if the event ran behind schedule.`

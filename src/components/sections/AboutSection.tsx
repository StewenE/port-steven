          I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for learning new skills and technologies. I'm currently finishing my Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology at TalTech.
          My interest in computers and technology stems from my childhood, where I did not yet know anything about the existance of programming, but I spent a lot of time around computers and video games.
          I guess that's where curiousity about how things really work began and later led me to programming.

          It was in the beginning of my university days when I started taking software development more seriously and actually started building projects of my own. I guess I could call myself a full-stack developer,
          as I am able to work on both the backend and the frontend, but my main focus and interest lies in backend development.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-8 opacity-0 animate-fade-in-delay-3">
          I take pride in my desire and ability to stay organized and manage my time effectively. I love when things are in order and clean, especially when it comes to coding - a clean environment keeps me motivated and focused.
